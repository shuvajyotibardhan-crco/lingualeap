# DESIGN — LinguaLeap

> App name: **LinguaLeap** (formerly "Amigos de Aventura" — renamed to be language-agnostic as French, Italian, etc. will be added alongside Spanish)

## High-Level Overview

LinguaLeap is a client-side-only progressive web app. There is no backend server or Cloud Functions — all game logic runs in the browser, all persistence goes directly to Firebase Firestore via the client SDK, and all speech (TTS + ASR) uses the browser's built-in Web Speech API. Firebase Auth handles identity; Firebase Hosting serves the static build. This keeps the running cost at zero and the architecture simple: React renders the UI, custom hooks manage state and side-effects, and JSON files under `public/data/es/` supply all phrase content.

## Module Design

### `src/lib/firebase.js`
Initialises the Firebase app with environment variables and exports `auth` (Firebase Auth instance) and `db` (Firestore instance). Single source of Firebase config — imported by all hooks that need Auth or Firestore.

### `src/lib/tts.js`
Wraps `window.speechSynthesis`. Exports `speak(text, lang)` — cancels any current utterance, selects the best matching voice for the given language code (`es-ES`, `es-MX` preference order), then calls `speechSynthesis.speak()`. Falls back to the default voice if no Spanish voice is available.

### `src/lib/asr.js`
Wraps `window.SpeechRecognition` (or `webkitSpeechRecognition`). Exports `startListening(lang, onResult, onError)` and `stopListening()`. Returns `null` and calls `onError('unsupported')` on browsers without the API — callers must render the tap-to-select fallback in that case.

### `src/lib/fuzzy.js`
Exports `similarity(a, b): number` — computes normalised Levenshtein similarity between two strings (both lowercased, diacritics stripped). Returns a value from 0.0 to 1.0. Used by Shadow Challenge to determine pass (≥0.6) or retry (<0.6).

### `src/context/AuthContext.jsx`
Provides `{ user, loading }` via React Context. Wraps `onAuthStateChanged` so the whole app reacts to login/logout. All protected routes check `user` from this context. `user.emailVerified` is used by ProtectedRoute to gate email/password accounts until they verify.

### `src/context/ProgressContext.jsx`
Provides `{ progress, loading, awardXP, completeLevel, isLevelUnlocked, calculateStars }` via React Context. Reads the user's Firestore document (`users/{uid}`) on mount and writes back on every XP/star/badge change via a single atomic `setDoc` merge. Uses Firestore's offline persistence to queue writes when offline.

### `src/hooks/useLevelData.js`
Fetches `/data/es/level_N.json` on mount (or when `level` changes). Returns `{ phrases, loading, error }`. Includes a cancellation guard so stale responses from a previous level are ignored.

### `src/hooks/useNounBank.js`
Fetches `/data/es/noun_bank.json` once on mount. Returns `{ entries, loading }`. Entries are the 15 swappable words from the Traveller's Noun Bank grouped by category (people, places, food, items).

### `src/hooks/useTTS.js`
Thin React hook wrapping `lib/tts.js`. Returns `{ speak, isSpeaking }`.

### `src/hooks/useASR.js`
Thin React hook wrapping `lib/asr.js`. Returns `{ startListening, stopListening, transcript, isListening, isSupported }`.

### `src/hooks/useProgress.js`
Re-exports context values from ProgressContext for ergonomic consumption in components.

### `public/data/es/level_N.json — served at /data/es/level_N.json`
One JSON file per level. Each file is an array of phrase objects:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "es-1-1",
    "spanish": "¡Hola!",
    "english": "Hello",
    "audioHint": "OH-lah",
    "category": "greeting"
  }
]
```
Adding a new language = adding `/public/data/{lang}/` with equivalent files. No engine changes needed.

### `src/pages/LevelMap.jsx`
Renders the 12-level grid. Reads unlock state from ProgressContext. Locked levels show a padlock icon and are not clickable. XP total shown in the header at all times.

### `src/pages/LevelPage.jsx`
Entry point for a level. Waits for ProgressContext to finish loading before checking `isLevelUnlocked` (guards against redirect race on direct URL navigation). Fetches the level's phrase JSON and noun bank data, then renders a mode-selector UI with a 📚 Word Bank button. Passes `nounBankEntries` to all mode components.

### `src/modes/Discovery.jsx`
Displays an illustrated scene. Each tappable object calls `speak(spanishWord)`. No scoring — purely exploratory.

### `src/modes/ShadowChallenge.jsx`
1. Plays TTS of the target phrase.
2. Shows mic button → calls `startListening`.
3. On transcript received: runs `similarity(transcript, spanish)`.
4. ≥0.60 → pass animation + XP award. <0.60 → "Try again!" (no XP penalty).
5. Falls back to tap-to-select when ASR unavailable.

### `src/modes/Roleplay.jsx`
Shows a "How to play" banner explaining the listen-then-respond mechanic. Presents an English situation prompt ("Someone says to you: …"). User responds by speaking (ASR) or tapping the correct Spanish phrase. Completes with a reward animation. XP awarded per phrase.

### `src/modes/QuickFire.jsx`
Audio-only challenge — Spanish word is NOT shown in the prompt, preventing trivial text-matching. Auto-plays phrase TTS on each round. Shows 4 Spanish word cards with a countdown timer. Correct tap → XP + next phrase. Wrong tap or timeout → "Try again!" + replay audio.

### `src/components/PhraseCard.jsx`
Reusable card showing Spanish text, English translation, and a TTS play button. Used across all modes.

### `src/components/RewardAnimation.jsx`
Plays a CSS/Lottie animation on level completion or badge award. Auto-dismisses after 2 seconds.

### `src/components/NounBank.jsx`
Slide-up panel showing the 15 Traveller's Noun Bank words grouped by category (People, Places, Food, Items). Accessible from the mode-selector header and from within every mode via a 📚 button. Tapping a word plays its TTS.

### `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
GitHub Actions workflow: triggers on push to `main`, installs deps, builds with env vars from GitHub Secrets, and deploys to Firebase Hosting via `FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy@v0`. Firestore security rules are managed directly in the Firebase Console (the service account credential scoped to Hosting deploy does not carry the Service Usage permissions required for `firebase-tools` rules deployment).

## Design Considerations

**Why React + Vite over Next.js?**
This is a pure client-side app — no SSR, no API routes, no server. Vite's HMR makes game UI iteration fast, and the Vite PWA plugin generates the service worker with zero config. Next.js would add complexity for no benefit.

**Why Firebase over Supabase or PlanetScale?**
Firebase Auth has built-in Google OAuth, email/password, and custom SMTP support in one SDK. Firestore's offline persistence handles the "works on a plane" requirement without extra code. Both fit the zero-cost constraint (Spark plan free tier). The global CLAUDE.md CI/CD pattern is already built around Firebase Hosting + GitHub Actions.

**Why client-side only (no Cloud Functions)?**
Every operation (auth, read progress, write XP) can be done safely from the client with Firestore security rules. Eliminating Cloud Functions removes billing risk, cold-start latency, and deployment complexity.

**Why browser-native TTS/ASR?**
Cost is zero, audio never leaves the device (privacy), and no API key management. The trade-off is browser support variance — mitigated by the ASR tap-to-select fallback and TTS voice fallback.

**Why fuzzy matching at ≥60%?**
Children learning a language will mispronounce words. A strict exact-match would be frustrating. 60% is low enough to reward genuine attempts while filtering out silence or completely wrong words. The threshold is a constant in `fuzzy.js` — easy to adjust after user testing.

**Why JSON data files over Firestore for phrase content?**
Phrase data is static and read-only. JSON files are bundled into the service worker cache at build time, making them available offline with zero Firestore reads. Firestore is reserved for per-user mutable state only.

**Why language data in `/public/data/{lang}/`?**
Keeps the engine entirely language-agnostic. To add French, a developer creates `/public/data/fr/level_1.json` through `level_12.json` and passes `lang="fr"` to the TTS and ASR hooks. No component or hook changes needed.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend framework | React 18 + Vite | Fast DX, component model, HMR |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first, rapid kid-UI iteration |
| Routing | React Router v6 | SPA routing, protected route support |
| Auth | Firebase Auth | Google OAuth + email/password, free |
| Database | Firebase Firestore | Offline persistence, free tier, per-user docs |
| TTS | Web Speech API (`SpeechSynthesis`) | Browser-native, zero cost, no network |
| ASR | Web Speech API (`SpeechRecognition`) | Browser-native, private, zero cost |
| Fuzzy match | Custom Levenshtein (`fuzzy.js`) | No dependency, tiny, tuneable threshold |
| PWA / offline | Vite PWA plugin (Workbox) | Auto-generates service worker |
| Icons | Lucide React | MIT, free, tree-shakeable |
| Illustrations | unDraw | CC0, free SVG scenes |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | Matches global CLAUDE.md deploy pattern |
| Hosting | Firebase Hosting | CDN, free tier, same Firebase project |

## Deployment

1. Developer pushes to `main` on GitHub.
2. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` triggers.
3. Workflow installs deps, builds with env vars from GitHub Actions Secrets (`VITE_FIREBASE_*`).
4. Build output (`dist/`) deployed to Firebase Hosting via `FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy@v0`.
5. Firestore security rules deployed via `firebase-tools` using the service account JSON secret.
6. Live URL: Firebase Hosting default domain (or custom domain if configured later).

No manual `firebase deploy` step is ever needed or used — Firebase CLI login is unreliable on this machine.

## Constraints & Known Limitations

| Constraint | Detail |
|---|---|
| ASR browser support | Chrome/Edge: full. Safari: partial (requires user gesture per session). Firefox: not supported → tap-to-select fallback shown. |
| TTS voice quality | Depends on OS-installed voices. Mobile devices typically have one Spanish voice; desktop varies. No control over voice quality. |
| Offline auth | Firebase Auth `onAuthStateChanged` works offline for already-signed-in users. New sign-in requires network. |
| Firestore offline | Queued writes flush on reconnect, but there is no UI indicator for "pending sync" in v1. |
| Illustration coverage | unDraw SVGs cover generic scenes well; level-specific themed scenes may require custom SVG work. |
| No parent dashboard | Progress is visible only to the logged-in user. Parental oversight requires sharing a login. |
| 60% ASR threshold | Chosen conservatively for encouragement; may need tuning after real-child user testing. |
